# The details of the projects are:


## 1) Safety Mechanism For a Cutting Machine
Components:
Solenoid
Piezo Buzzer
Toggle Switch, Limit Switch & Push Button
Ultrasonic Sensor

Functions:
Toggle Switch acts as a master switch such that nothing will happen if itâ€™s not switched on.
The Limit Switch is a safety door that is if the cutter is in operation, releasing it will immediately stop all operations and rings the piezo buzzer.
The push button is one that begins the cutting operation when the toggle is switched on.

## 2) Car Reverse Sensor
Components:
Ultrasonic Sensors
LEDs
Piezo Buzzer

Functions:
When the car is in reverse mode, the distance measured can be classified into three classes (ie. close, moderate, far) based on predefined values.
As the distance decreases, the piezo buzzer buzzes with higher frequencies and the LED switches from green to red respectively.

## 3) Gantry Crane (Simulator)
Components Used:
Potentiometer
Servo Motor
DC Motor
Pushbutton & Toggle Switch

Functions:
The potentiometer controls the position of the gantry crane hoist, in which the Servo Motor moves accordingly.
When it is in position, activating the push button will rotate the DC Motor to grab the object.
The toggle switch determines whether the object will be raised or lowered.

## 4) Calculator
Components Used:
Arduino Uno
Potentiometer
Keypad
LCD Display

Functions:
Programmed to perform various arithmetic and mathematical operations.
Contrast of the LCD Screen can be adjusted using the potentiometer.

## 5) Accelerometer & Inclinometer
Components Used:
Arduino Uno
Accelerometer

Functions:
Measures the acceleration in the x, y, and z direction.
The information can then be used to derive inclination and thus measure tilt of the board.
